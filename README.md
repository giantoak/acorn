# Acorn - A set of tools for transforming place names into location data [in development]

Acorn resolves place names into FIPS codes, census geo\_ids, and gathers data from the American Community Survey and Uniform Crime Statistics data. Who knows where this will go?

TODO:

- Add support for ACS 3-year and 5-year databases
- Make pipeline into Drakefile
- Write this documentation
- Make it possible to write rules to map colloquial names to canonical names
- Clean up data directory
- Upload to AWS and make into an AMI snapshot
